IP Authorization Plugin for Windows Media Services
=========

This plugin allows easily restrict access to Windows Media Services by user IP address range via simple configuration file. It is an improved replacement of standard WMS IP address authorization functionality. 

All you need to do is to install the plugin and fill the config file with restricted IPs list.
